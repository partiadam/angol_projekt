            <h2>Bloody Caesar</h2>
            <p>
                The Caesar, also known as the Bloody Caesar, is considered Canada’s national cocktail. <br> The key ingredients are vodka, clam juice, tomato juice, 
                spices
                and Worcestershire sauce. <br> It is typically served in a highball glass rimmed with <br> celery salt and garnished
                with a celery stalk, olives and lime. <br> Food and beverage worker Walter Chell invented the Caesar in Calgary,
                Alberta, in 1969. <br> Since then, the drink’s popularity and origin have made it a national cultural icon. <br> Canadians drink more than 400 million Caesars
                annually. <br> However, it has not achieved significant reach beyond Canada.
                
                <h2>Rise in popularity</h2>
                Within a few years, the Bloody Caesar cocktail was a favourite around Calgary. <br> It sold especially well as a lunchtime drink. <br> 
                The Caesar’s popularity then spread eastward from Western Canada. <br> In 2006, the cocktail was ranked No. 13 on the CBC TV series The Greatest Canadian Invention.

                <h2>Variations</h2>

                Many Caesar cocktail variations exist. <br> Some have used sriracha sauce, hoisin sauce, <br> beef stock, tandoori, jerk spice, strawberries, or maple-flavoured BBQ sauce. <br> 
                Others have garnished their cocktails with grilled corn, steamed clams, maki, or cinnamon sticks. <br> Tim Hortons coffee grounds have been used as a Caesar rimmer. <br>
                The vodka can be replaced with other spirits. <br> A beer-based Caesar cocktail is known as a Clam Eye.
