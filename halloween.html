            <h2>Halloween Decorations</h2>
            <p>
                Halloween is one of the most important and exciting times of the Canadian year. <br>
                People around the world celebrate this harvest festival, and it's an equally big
                deal in Canada. <br> It is thought to be worth over a billion Canadian dollars a year! <br>
                Some people put a lot of effort into decorating their homes and front yard. <br> Pumpkins or Jack-o’-lanterns are usually placed near their front door or windows. <br> 
                It is common for Canadians to go all out with their Halloween decorations by putting spooky objects inside and outside the house. <br>

                Walk around your neighborhood to see how your neighbors set up their Halloween decorations.

            <h2>Customes</h2>

                

                On October 31st, children can wear simple costumes to school. <br> Each school may have its guidelines for Halloween costumes. Make sure to follow them. <br> 
                You will see people wearing costumes on the streets or even at the office! <br> Back in the day, it is common for people to dress up as scary characters. <br> 
                Nowadays you can dress up as fictional characters, animals, food items, superheroes, or anything you like. <br>

                When choosing Halloween costumes for your children, make sure to choose a flame-resistant costume! <br> Especially if they plan to go out for trick-or-treat. <br>

                The only downside about Halloween in Canada is that it happens at the end of the Fall season. <br> 
                So, you might need to wear a winter coat over your Halloween costume when trick-or-treating.

            <h2>Christian Tradition</h2>
            Centuries later, Roman Catholics celebrated All Saints Day on November 1. <br> Also known as “All Hallows’ Day,” Christians used the occasion to honour saints and 
            those who 
            had recently passed away. <br> The night before, or Hallows’ Eve, was also celebrated which we now refer to as Halloween.
