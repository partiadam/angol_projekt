            <h2>Christmas in Canada</h2>
            <p>Although celebrations in Canada share many similarities with those seen in the United States, Canada has several distinctive cultures, which mean there<br> 
                are some notable differences as well.<br>
                <h2>Something unique</h2>

                However, one widespread tradition in English-speaking parts of the country is the use of real fir or pine Christmas trees, and this is especially common<br> 
                in the eastern province of Nova Scotia, where huge trees can be seen in towns and cities.<br>

                <h2>Family traditions</h2>

                Many Canadian families choose to exchange their gifts on Christmas Eve, rather than Christmas Day, while others open one present on Christmas Eve and the<br>
                remainder on the 25th December.<br>

                <h2>Boxing day</h2>

                As with the United Kingdom, Boxing Day is a recognised holiday in Canada and many people use it as a shopping day, with stores opening early and<br> 
                providing discount prices. In some parts of the country, such as northern Ontario, stores are not allowed to open on Boxing Day and in these areas, <br>
                an equivalent sale usually takes place on the 27th.
          
                <h2>Background</h2>

                Many Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus of Nazareth in Bethlehem on December 25, although the true date and year of his birth is unclear. <br>
                The tradition of celebrating his birth at the end of December may come from the widespread European tradition of celebrations around the winter solstice.<br> 
                Christians who follow the Eastern Orthodox tradition celebrate the birth of Jesus on January 7, while it is marked on January 6 by the Armenian Apostolic Church.</p>
